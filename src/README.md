#### Welcome to Photon Code Challenge!

#### In order to complete this coding solution, please read below steps and requirements:

We are going to build the APIs to serve the data for Product Category page.

1. Please create an API that will return the list of Product Category with 4 subcategory on it with 3 example product category. Please refer to (static/images/product-category-list.jpg)

2. Please create an API that will return the list of Product Subcategory with parameter to get the specific subcategory from product category. Please refer to (static/images/product-subcategory-list.jpg)

3. Please create an API to show the product details with parameter to get the specific product from product subcategory. It need to contain name of product, price, description, stock availability, and product image. Please refer to (static/images/product-details.jpg)

4. Save your work by typing CMD+S for Mac, or CTRL+S for Windows machine. You can refresh your app preview in the right side to see the API updates you've done.

You can create your mock data (src/static/mock-data.json) to perform the requirements above.
